## About 
Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase..


## Model
The model used here is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoid func. removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1. As it a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.
